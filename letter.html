	<h2>Re:Eileen Dover university application.</h2>
	<p>Dear Eileen;</p>
	<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the university of Awesome's science faculty to study as part </p><p>of your PHD next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Starting dates</h3>
	<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you </p><p>could start at the beginning of the semester. The start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <br>
    <ul><li>First Semester :9th September 2016.</li>
        <li>Second Semester :15th January 2017.</li>
        <li>Third Semester :2th May 2017.</li> </ul>
    <br>
     <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so, which start date you would prefer.	</p>
	 <br>
	 <P>You can find more information about <a href ="">important university dates</a> on our website.</P>
	 <br>
	 <h3>Subjects of study.	 </h3>
	 <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty we have a plenty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall </p><p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent , dedicated researcher, and just</p><p> like the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued </p><p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p> 
     <br>
	 <P>
	  <ol><li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
	  <li>Measuring the effect on performnce of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30&#8451(86&#8457),when the</p><p> audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3*10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3*10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
	  <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores </li></ol>
	  <br>
	<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you'd expect the </p><p>research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.
       </p><br>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves.</h3>
    <p>Yes, your right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,</p><p> my favourite dances are as follows,with definitions:</p>
      <br>
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <ol> <P>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around</p><p> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>  	
    </ol>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <ol><p>Before the Icelanders developes fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practise this dance, which</p><p> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling thei bodies around in imperceptibly </p><p>tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</p><p> modern styles such as Twerking. </p></ol>	
   <p>Arctic Robot Dance</p>
   <ol><p>An intresting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</p><p> discoverd a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being practised by inhabitants</p><p> of Northern Alska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</p><p> because they were really cold. </p></ol>
   <p>For more of my research see my, <a href ="" >exotic dance research page</a></p>
   <br>
   <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
   <br>
